# /graphify path

Find the shortest path between two named concepts in the graph.

```bash
graphify path "NODE_A" "NODE_B"
```

Replace `NODE_A` and `NODE_B` with the actual concept names. Then explain the path in plain language - what each hop means, why it's significant.

After writing the explanation, save it back:

```bash
$(cat graphify-out/.graphify_python) -m graphify save-result --question "Path from NODE_A to NODE_B" --answer "ANSWER" --type path_query --nodes NODE_A NODE_B
```
