  Then re-run this skill to confirm.
```

## FIX verdict

One or more failures. Do not merge. Surface blockers and suggest corrective actions.

PR #1234 — Enable experimental caching layer
Branch: feat/cache-layer → main  |  Author: @lucas  |  Updated: 2d ago

SIGNALS
  ✓ Not draft
  ✗ Mergeable: CONFLICTING
    - Conflict in src/cache.ts
    - Conflict in src/index.ts
  ✗ CI: 2/12 checks failing
    - test-backend (failed 3 times) → https://...
    - lint-style (failed) → https://...
  ✓ Reviews: APPROVED by @reviewer
  ✓ Branch: 3 commits behind base
  ✓ CodeRabbit: no unresolved comments
  ⚠ PR size: 1247 LOC, 28 files (large)
  ✓ Branch age: updated 2h ago

VERDICT: FIX

Blockers (required):
  1. Merge conflicts in src/cache.ts and src/index.ts — resolve conflicts, commit, push
  2. CI failing on test-backend (3 failures) and lint-style — fix tests/lint, push

Warnings (address before merge):
  1. PR is very large (1247 LOC, 28 files) — verify scope is intentional

Suggested next actions:
  /gh-fix-ci  (troubleshoot + fix failing checks)
  Then resolve conflicts:
    git rebase main
    (resolve + git add .)
    git rebase --continue
  Then re-run this skill to confirm.
```

## Network failure (transient)

If any signal cannot be queried due to network failure, mark that signal as `WARN` ("could not check — connectivity issue") and continue. Never silently treat unknown as PASS.

PR #1234 — Update API schema validation
Branch: feat/schema-validation → main  |  Author: @lucas  |  Updated: 1h ago

SIGNALS
  ✓ Not draft
  ✓ Mergeable (clean)
  ⚠ CI: could not fetch checks (network error) — will retry
  ✓ Reviews: APPROVED by @reviewer
  ✓ Branch: 0 commits behind base
  ✓ CodeRabbit: no unresolved comments
  ✓ PR size: 156 LOC, 4 files
  ✓ Branch age: updated 1h ago

VERDICT: WAIT

Reason: CI status could not be determined due to network error. Wait for CI to complete,
then re-run this skill to confirm all checks pass.

Suggested next action:
  ci-watch 1234  (monitor CI status)
  Then re-run this skill.
