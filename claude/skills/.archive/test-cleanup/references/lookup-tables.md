# Proportionality Lookup Tables

## Efficient Test Count by App Type

Map source LOC to the proportionality table to set your count target:

| App type | Source LOC | Efficient test count |
|---|---|---|
| Browser extension | ~3k | 40–150 |
| CLI tool | ~2k | 30–120 |
| REST API (≤20 routes) | ~4k | 80–250 |
| Full-stack app | ~15k | 200–600 |
| Large multi-subsystem app | 15k–50k | 500–1500 |

The large multi-subsystem row covers services with many distinct feature modules. Treat
the count as a ceiling, not a floor: aggressive deletion below the lower bound should
only happen if integration coverage stays and the suite shrinks organically.

## Coverage Exclusion Patterns

Use these patterns before lowering the coverage gate. Excluding generated or logic-free files is cleaner than lowering the threshold, because the threshold still enforces real coverage on real code.

```ts
// jest.config.ts / vitest.config.ts
coveragePathIgnorePatterns: [
  '/node_modules/',
  '/__generated__/',   // generated GraphQL or Prisma types
  '/src/types/',       // pure TS interfaces and enums
  '/src/constants/',   // pure constants with no logic
  '/src/migrations/',  // DB migrations
]
```
