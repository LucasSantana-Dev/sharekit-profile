# next-priority

Choose the next action using evidence, not intuition.

## Decision order

This list is the SINGLE canonical ranking (references/priority-rules.md holds
PR-state interpretation detail, not a second ranking).

1. Merge-ready PRs
2. Release blockers
3. Failing CI, flaky tests, or stale-base PRs blocking merges (stale-base = PR
   targets a branch already merged into default; retarget before it can ship)
4. Security issues with a known safe fix
5. Overdue date-gated commitments — "re-check X by <date>" items from handoffs
   and memory whose date has passed (scan command in references/scan-commands.md)
6. Small production-ready fixes or features
7. Concrete tech debt slowing delivery
8. Refactors justified by churn or repeated friction
9. Deferred migrations or speculative work

If the picked action is irreversible or outward-facing (merge, deploy, publish,
history rewrite), the pick stands but execution follows the autonomy tiers in
`~/.claude/standards/autonomy-tiers.md` (ADR-0051) — this skill chooses, it does
not bypass gates.

### Waiting for CI is never a priority

"Merge-ready PRs" (rank 1) means a PR whose checks have **already passed** and is
mergeable now. A PR whose CI is **still running** is NOT merge-ready and NOT a
priority — never pick "wait for / poll the PR's CI" as the next action. CI
completion re-surfaces the PR via its own notification; until then, drop to the
next actionable item and do real work. **Sole exception:** the next task is
blocked *on that exact code* — it needs the in-flight branch's changes to
proceed. Only then is the in-flight PR the gating item, and even then advance any
independent work first. Idle-polling an in-flight PR is a priority-inversion.

## Required evidence

Check, in order:
- active handoff
- overdue date-gated items (handoffs + memory date scan — see scan-commands.md)
- active plan
- current branch and open PRs
- CI status on the current branch / HEAD
- open review comments or blocking issues
- recent commits and working tree state

Staleness rule: if any gathered evidence predates the repo's last commit
(`git log -1 --format=%ct` vs when the evidence was produced), flag it in the
output and re-gather that item before committing to a verdict. Advisory only —
never auto-rerun expensive pipelines.

## Output

Signal-first: one-line verdict before detail.

```
Priority: <single action>
Why: <one-line reason it outranks alternatives>
Blocked by: <what stops it, or "nothing">
Next step: <smallest concrete action>
```

Do not list every alternative considered — only surface the top action and its nearest competitor if the choice was close.

## Blocker escape hatches

When the top candidate is blocked, apply the matching pattern before falling back to the next priority:

| Blocker | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Self-approve blocked on own PR | Branch protection requires review you can't give yourself. If `enforce_admins: true` → `DELETE .../enforce_admins` → admin-merge → re-`POST` to re-enable. Document in PR body. |
| Webhook desync (PR head SHA stale) | Close the PR + open a fresh PR from same branch. Empty-commit nudges rarely fix it. |
| PR `mergeStateStatus: BEHIND` | `gh pr update-branch` first; if 422 conflict, local rebase + force-push-with-lease |
| `CONFLICTING` but local `git merge-tree` is clean | Webhook desync — same recipe as above |
| All open PRs blocked on outside review | Write the smallest unblocking comment (clarify scope, link tests, ping reviewer). Escalate to user if >24h stuck. |
| Everything blocked + plans exist | Execute Phase 1 of the earliest-dated plan. Phase 1 is usually inventory/read-only and safe to advance unilaterally. |
| Nothing actionable | Run a diagnostic skill (`/hook-effectiveness`, `/skill-effectiveness-audit`, `/config-drift-detect`) instead of inventing work. |
