# Operator Harness Documentation

**Comprehensive reference guide for a fully-configured OpenCode / Claude Code operator environment with 50 skills, 40+ agents, automated hook pipeline, RAG retrieval, memory persistence, and integrated MCP servers.**

> **Harnesses:** OpenCode (primary, `opencode.json`) → Claude Code (supported) → OpenRouter (fallback provider). The skill/agent/hook library is harness-agnostic and works across both.

---

## Quick Start: Daily Operations

### Starting a session

**OpenCode (preferred):**
```bash
opencode   # Opens OpenCode — reads opencode.json, routes via primary provider
```

**Claude Code (supported):**
```bash
claude   # Opens Claude Code CLI
```

**Fallback provider:** when the primary provider is rate-limited or unavailable, OpenCode routes through OpenRouter. Configure once with `opencode auth login openrouter` (set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

The session start hook chain fires automatically:
- Auto-pulls latest state from `~/.claude-env`
- Reindexes any drifted RAG chunks
- Alerts if main branch has diverged
- Alerts if memory index is oversized

### Processing your first prompt
Every user prompt triggers `UserPromptSubmit` hooks (0-overhead):

1. **Auto-recall** — `autorecall-hook.sh` injects relevant docs as `# Knowledge graph context` block
2. **Model routing** — `model-tier-router.sh` routes to Haiku/Sonnet/Opus based on complexity
3. **Composite detection** — `composite-router.sh` emits `🎯 Composite match: /<name>` if your intent matches a composite skill
4. **Auto-context-pack** — if context >85%, automatically compacts context

### Most common daily patterns

| Task | Use This | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Start day, understand blocking work | `/session-bootstrap` | Chains wake-up → next-priority → pr-snapshot → context-pack |
| Plan before coding | `/plan` | Validation-gated plan for multi-step work |
| Implement independently-parallelizable tasks | `/dispatch` or `/orchestrate` | Fans out parallel agents, reconciles results |
| Review code before merge | `/review` | Severity-rated findings (bugs, regressions, security > style) |
| Debug a failing test or prod error | `/debug` | Systematic root-cause analysis |
| Full project health check | `/quality-assurance` | Composes tests, config, hooks, security, MCP, and release evidence |
| Refactor a module end-to-end | `/request-refactor-plan` → `/orchestrate` | Plans, fans out bounded work, validates, and captures decisions |
| Ship work + capture memory | `/ship` + `/knowledge-loop` | Releases work, syncs memory, and writes handoff when needed |

### When to use composites vs. individual skills

**Always prefer composites** when the composite-router hook emits `🎯 Composite match`. Composites auto-chain phases and enforce gates. Running sub-skills manually bypasses critical phases.

Marked with `*` in skill lists below.

Example: User says "refactor this module."
- Correct: use `/request-refactor-plan` for scope/rollback, then `/orchestrate` or `/three-man-team` when parallel implementation is justified.
- Wrong: invoke `/refactor` directly for a broad module rewrite, skipping discovery and validation.

### OpenCode + OpenRouter + Gajae-Code integration

`sharekit install` now mirrors two additional tool roots alongside `claude/` and `cursor/`:

- **`opencode/`** → `~/.config/opencode/`. Ships a portable `opencode.jsonc` with OpenCode Go (`opencode` provider) as the primary gateway and OpenRouter as the fallback (`options.provider.allow_fallbacks: true`). API keys are read from env vars (`OPENCODE_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) — never hardcoded. Agent tiering mirrors the CLAUDE.md discipline: Sonnet-class for `build`/`architect`/`planner`/`critic`, Flash-class for `task`, cheapest for `title`. Analysis roles (architect, planner, critic) are read-only by construction (`permission: { edit: deny, bash: deny }`). This is a *portable default* — your personal `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc` is left intact; OpenCode merges project + global configs.
- **`gjc/`** → `~/.gjc/`. Ships the documented `config.yml` retry budget (the user-facing config surface). gjc is an external runner that sits beside OpenCode/Claude Code and adds the `deep-interview → ralplan → ultragoal` workflow loop (optional `team` for parallel tmux workers). Model/provider selection in gjc uses a separate `models.yml` + `modelBindings` system; this profile intentionally does not override that. The four role-agent markdown files (`executor`, `architect`, `planner`, `critic`) are reference templates aligned with the operator's CLAUDE.md hard rules.

Both ship as **portable defaults**: installing this profile gives sane starting configs without clobbering personal overrides.

## Hook Lifecycle: What Fires When

Hooks are shell scripts wired to tool events. They are zero-overhead on success (exit 0 = silent), auto-killed at timeout (3-5s default), and logged on failure.

### SessionStart (fires once per session)
1. Log session start
2. Merge stale RAG chunks into live index
3. Pull latest memories + ADRs from env
4. Detect and reindex drifted files
5. Alert if main branch has drifted
6. Alert if memory index oversized

### UserPromptSubmit (fires on every prompt)
1. Auto-recall: semantic search, inject `# Knowledge graph context`
2. Classify prompt complexity (simple/moderate/complex/xcomplex)
3. Emit model tier hint (Haiku → Sonnet → Opus)
4. Log turn count
5. Warn if context >85%, suggest `/compact`
6. If intent matches composite: emit `🎯 Composite match: /<name>`
7. Warn if on release branch

### PreToolUse (safety gates)
- Filter dangerous bash (rm -rf, sudo rm, etc.)
- Block writes to protected paths
- Block re-reading same file twice

### PostToolUse (observe & learn)
- `[Bash]` → detect missed read-tool-kick opportunities
- `[Read]` → warn if >25KB, log which files read
- `[Write|Edit]` → reindex changed files
- `[*]` → log turn count, check token budget
- `[Edit]` → warn if >3 edits in one turn
- `[Write|Edit|MultiEdit]` → validate skill writes

### PreCompact / PostCompact / Stop / SessionEnd
- Pre/Post compact: snapshot state before/after compression
- Stop: log token usage, check rate limits
- SessionEnd: sync RAG and memories to persistent storage

### Enforcement & self-improvement (hook wiring)

Hooks are registered to lifecycle events in [`claude/settings.json`](claude/settings.json). Before that file existed, the `hooks/` scripts were orphan artifacts and 9 of 15 `RULES.md` "Must Always" rules were advisory-only. The registered events now enforce the protected invariants at runtime:

- `PreToolUse` (Bash) — `check-dangerous-patterns.sh` (destructive commands + sensitive paths), `check-pr-automation-halt.sh` (no force-push, no push to main, no AI-attribution in commits, halt on human-commented PRs), `check-stuck-loop.sh` (Stuck protocol), `check-idempotency.sh` (state-check-before-mutation hint). Exit 2 blocks.
- `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit) — idempotency hint (logged to trajectory).
- `SubagentStart` — `check-read-only-subagent.sh` blocks analysis subagents spawned with write tools (read-only-by-construction).
- `PostToolUse` — `trajectory-log.sh` appends every tool call to `.harness/runtime/trajectory.jsonl` (the observe half of the flywheel), then `context-guard.sh` writes compact digests for >2KB responses (tool-result firewall) + surfaces buried constraints (lost-in-the-middle audit), then `observe-otel.sh` emits a GenAI span + scans for context breaches.
- `PreCompact` / `PostCompact` — snapshot pre-compaction state + re-inject CORE memory so hard rules survive compaction.
- `Stop` — `post-incident-adr.sh` reminds on P0/P1 error spikes.
- `SessionEnd` — `session-end-flush.sh` writes a session record and queues it for the nightly distill.

The runtime log directory (`.harness/runtime/`) is gitignored — it is append-only fuel for the self-improvement loop, not source of truth. See [`docs/flywheel.md`](docs/flywheel.md) for the full observe → evaluate → optimize loop and [`claude/memory-structure/SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md`](claude/memory-structure/SELF_IMPROVEMENT.md) for the memory promotion ladder, staleness scoring, and nightly distill protocol.

### Self-improvement flywheel (evaluate half — P1)

The evaluate/optimize scripts that consume the trajectory log. They are run on-demand (or nightly via cron); none auto-mutate semantic memory — graduation is always host-agent-reviewed with required rationale.

- `hooks/distill.sh` — nightly distill: mines the trajectory log + pending queue, applies a heuristic prefilter and confidence-scoring (failure 1.0, learning 0.9, decision 0.8, pattern 0.7), stages candidates to `.harness/forge/`. Supports `--status`.
- `hooks/review.sh` — host-agent review CLI: `list`, `show <date>`, `graduate <id> --rationale "..."`, `reject <id> --reason "..."`, `reopen`, `decisions`. Graduation requires a rationale (no rubber-stamping) and writes staleness frontmatter.
- `hooks/eval-baseline.sh` — with-skill vs no-skill baseline gate: `init`, `record`, `compare`, `gate <name> <threshold>`. Gates on measurable lift (selftune `baseline` pattern).
- `hooks/diagnose.sh` — self-diagnosis: clusters failures in the trajectory log, detects repeated errors / tool overuse / blind retries / token-waste patterns (SkillForge + AHE Agent Debugger). Writes a digest + machine-readable clusters.
- `hooks/transcript-scanner.sh` (P8.3) — post-hoc transcript scanners (inspect-ai): scans the trajectory for systemic patterns per-task evals miss — refusals, evaluation-awareness, environment-drift, hallucination signals, excessive-agency, prompt-injection tells. Complements `diagnose.sh` (failure clustering). Stages findings to `.harness/forge/`; never blocks. CLI: `--since <iso>`, `--status`.
- `hooks/observe-otel.sh` — two-knob observability (pdhoolia): level (off/metrics/trace) + destination (jsonl/stderr/otel). GenAI semantic span names, context-breach scanning, idempotent ±1 feedback scores. Local JSONL by default.

### Self-improvement flywheel (optimize half — P2)

The optimize half closes the loop: a proposer reads the full non-Markovian iteration history, proposes evidence-backed edits, is gated, deployed, watched, and auto-reverted on regression. Contract copied from meta-agent / harness-evolver / hermes-evolution — NOT a dependency (no DSPy/GEPA/LangSmith).

- `hooks/history.sh` — the #1 lever: append-only iteration history store. Every proposal + eval result + WHY it failed is preserved so the proposer reads WHY prior attempts failed (non-Markovian full-history search beats best-of-N, per the meta-harness result). NEVER prunes. `why <target>` surfaces failure reasons.
- `hooks/propose.sh` — evolutionary proposer: assembles a non-Markovian proposal context (iteration history + diagnosis + distill candidates + current file content + gate checklist) for the proposing model to fill in. NEVER commits directly.
- `hooks/gate.sh` — constraint gate: tests pass, skill size ≤15KB, cache compatibility, semantic preservation (held-out eval lift ≥ 0), Pareto selection. The gate auto-runs the held-out bench via `eval-run.sh --gate-authority` before reading the lift, so it populates its own results — the proposer never authors the held-out runs (evaluator-not-agent invariant).
- `hooks/deploy-watch.sh` — auto-rollback: monitors post-deploy metrics, auto-backs-up before any revert, reverts to git HEAD on regression, records the regression in history so the proposer learns from it.
- `hooks/repo-map.sh` — bounded, cache-stable structural map (file tree + symbol index, ≤8KB) so the proposer targets edits without flooding context.

### Self-improvement flywheel (exercise the loop — P3)

P3 makes the loop runnable as one command, ships the last two context-engineering defenses (both advisory — they never block), and ships the concrete eval bench that turns the gate from a recording mechanism into a real measurement.

- `hooks/cycle.sh` — end-to-end cycle runner: chains diagnose → distill → propose → gate → report in a single command, skipping steps gracefully from a cold start. NEVER commits — it writes a cycle report the host agent reviews. `--dry-run` previews, `--status` re-reads the last report, `--target <file>` anchors the proposal. This is the command that makes the flywheel exercisable on demand or on a schedule.
- `hooks/tool-shortlist.sh` (UserPromptSubmit) — surfaces only the tools whose keywords match the prompt instead of the full catalog, cutting system-prompt context (contextweaver 92.2% route-prompt reduction, agentforge deferred-tools 60-70% cut). CLI: `suggest "<prompt>"`, `--status`.
- `hooks/model-cache-guard.sh` (UserPromptSubmit + PostCompact) — flags mid-conversation model switches as cache-unsafe (switching mid-stream discards the cached prompt prefix). The only cache-safe switch boundaries are first-turn and post-compaction (Copilot pattern). CLI: `--status`, `--reset`.
- `hooks/eval-tasks.sh` — deterministic eval task catalog: 20 harness-behavior tasks (synthetic tool-call event + expected verdict + owning hook) split into **seen** (proposer trains on) and **heldout** (gate evaluates on; proposer never sees the per-task expected verdicts). The split is the overfitting defense — a harness edit that hard-codes the seen cases fails on held-out. CLI: `list [--split seen|heldout|all]`, `show <id>`, `count [--split ...]`.
- `hooks/eval-run.sh` — A/B task runner: runs each task in with/without variants and records to `eval-baseline.sh`. `with` invokes the target hook and checks the exit code matches the expected verdict; `without` simulates the harness absent. Enforces the held-out split — refuses `--split heldout` unless `--gate-authority` is passed, which only `gate.sh` supplies (evaluator-not-agent invariant). CLI: `--eval <name> --variant with|without [--split seen|heldout|all] [--gate-authority]`.

### Self-improvement flywheel (convergent cross-cutting patterns — P4)

P4 layers the five convergent cross-cutting patterns the Wave-5 research tracks agreed on: context control, governance, temporal memory, progressive disclosure, and deterministic orchestration. Each is advisory-or-gated, never trust-the-model.

- `hooks/compaction-guard.sh` (PreCompact) — hybrid context control: audits tool-call/result adjacency preservation during compaction so execution drift cannot hide in a condensed window, threshold-triggered budget warnings, cache-prefix stability advisory. Advisory; never blocks.
- `hooks/policy-gate.sh` (PreToolUse) — deterministic governance layer: emits ALLOW/DENY/REQUIRE_APPROVAL verdicts from `mcp-policy.json` outside the model, appends each decision to a hash-chained tamper-evident ledger bound to context hash, exits 2 on DENY. CLI: `--verify` ledger integrity, `--status` verdict counts.
- `hooks/memory-consolidate.sh` — sleep-cycle memory consolidation: clusters related facts, finds supersede candidates, finds compression clusters, decays stale+low-confidence facts — all staged to `.harness/forge/` and never auto-applied. Extends the promotion ladder with bi-temporal validity windows; see [`claude/memory-structure/TEMPORAL_KG.md`](claude/memory-structure/TEMPORAL_KG.md). CLI: `--dir <path>`, `--status`.
- `hooks/skill-index.sh` — progressive-disclosure skill index: builds a metadata-only index of the skill catalog (name + description + triggers + invocation_type + allow_implicit + size class, never bodies) so the host loads one skill body on demand instead of load-all. Skills with `invocation_type=slash` are excluded from auto-invocation; skills with `allow_implicit=false` (🔒) require explicit confirmation even on trigger match. CLI: `--dir <path>`, `--status`.
- `hooks/skill-prune.sh` — telemetry-based skill pruning: reads the trajectory and stages never-hit / low-hit skills as archive candidates. Archive, never `rm`. CLI: `--dir <path>`, `--status`.
- `hooks/skill-validate.sh` — frontmatter schema + security validation gate: validates all SKILL.md files for schema compliance (name ≤100 chars, description 20–500 chars, no body leaking into description, valid `invocation_type` and `allow_implicit` values) and scans for security threats (pipe-to-shell installers, secret exfiltration, reverse shells, obfuscated execution, prompt-injection lures). Exit 2 on critical findings; `--strict` exits 2 on any finding. CLI: `--dir <path>`, `--status`, `--strict`.
- `hooks/dispatch.sh` — deterministic orchestration substrate: a fixed state machine (intake → triage → plan → research → implement → review_gate → eval → merge_gate → done, with BLOCKED first-class) where no LLM decides what fires next. Bounded workers (including the P2 proposer/evaluator) execute steps; the substrate owns transitions and the two human-in-the-loop gates. See [`docs/handoff-schema.md`](docs/handoff-schema.md). CLI: `--intake`, `--advance`, `--block`, `--allow-gate`, `--status`, `--list`.

### Self-improvement flywheel (target architecture — P5)

P5 is the integration target: the flywheel from P0-P2 + the convergent patterns from P4, operating as a single closed loop. `hooks/cycle.sh` now exercises the whole architecture as one command, with two tracks run in sequence:

- **TRACK A — MAINTAIN** (the P4 substrate, periodic hygiene): `memory-consolidate.sh` (sleep-cycle), `skill-index.sh` (progressive-disclosure index with invocation_type + allow_implicit policy tagging), `skill-prune.sh` (telemetry-based archive candidates), `skill-validate.sh` (schema + security validation gate), `transcript-scanner.sh` (systemic pattern scan — complements `diagnose.sh`, P8.3). Advisory; stages reports, never auto-applies.
- **TRACK B — IMPROVE** (the P0-P3 flywheel, routed via `dispatch.sh`): `diagnose.sh` → `distill.sh` → `propose.sh` (at dispatch `implement` → `review_gate`) → `gate.sh` (at `eval`, with the held-out eval set the proposer never saw). On gate pass, dispatch advances to `merge_gate`; on regression, dispatch parks BLOCKED so the proposer reads WHY next time.

The cycle closes the evaluate→optimize loop through the deterministic substrate — never trusting the model to self-route or self-promote. See [`docs/target-architecture.md`](docs/target-architecture.md) for the five load-bearing subsystems and the eight load-bearing invariants. CLI: `--target <file>`, `--eval <set>`, `--dry-run`, `--status`, `--no-maintain`.

### Self-improvement flywheel (operational phase — P6)

P6 makes the flywheel actually operate in production: it schedules the cycle, seeds the trajectory for cold starts, fixes the first real finding the eval bench surfaced, and runs the first end-to-end propose → gate cycle against a live target.

- `hooks/trajectory-seed.sh` — cold-start trajectory fuel: synthesizes a small representative trajectory (mixed success/error/blocked events) so the improve track is exercisable before any real session runs. Idempotent — refuses to overwrite a non-empty trajectory; real sessions replace it. CLI: `--force`, `--status`.
- `check-pr-automation-halt.sh` (P6 fix) — now blocks `--admin` on ANY git/gh command (not just `git push`), since `--admin` bypasses branch protection regardless of subcommand. The eval bench surfaced this gap; a held-out task `pr-admin-review` locks the regression. This is the first real harness improvement driven by the bench — proof the loop works.
- `scripts/launchd/flywheel.plist.template` + `scripts/install-scheduler.sh` — opt-in macOS launchd agent that runs the cycle nightly at 02:00. Per-project (the cycle writes to `.harness/runtime/`); install once per project you want the flywheel to improve. CLI: `install [root]`, `uninstall`, `status`, `run`.
- [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md) — operational runbook: cold-start → warm-start, scheduler install, reading a cycle report, interpreting the held-out lift, rollback procedure. The first real cycle (against the `--admin` fix) passed end-to-end with held-out lift=0.667.

### Self-improvement flywheel (close-the-loop — P7)

P7 closes the loop between the gate and deploy. Before P7, the gate measured the *live* hook on disk — to validate a proposal the host had to mutate the live hook, run the gate, and revert on failure (no isolation between current and proposed). P7 adds isolated candidate gating and wires deploy-watch into the cycle.

- `hooks/trial-apply.sh` — materializes a proposed edit from a proposal `.md` into a *trial copy* at `.harness/forge/trial/<proposal-id>/` (the live hook is never touched). Extracts the unified diff from the proposal's section 6, applies it via `patch`, backs up the pristine copy, emits the candidate path on stdout. Rejects a leftover `FILL IN` placeholder or a malformed diff (exit 2).
- `hooks/gate.sh` (P7) — gains `--proposal <file>`: calls `trial-apply.sh`, runs the held-out bench AGAINST THE CANDIDATE via `eval-run.sh --candidate`, records the candidate path on PASS, discards the trial dir on FAIL. The live hook is byte-identical before and after the gate run. Falls back to live-hook measurement when `--proposal` is omitted.
- `hooks/eval-run.sh` (P7) — gains `--candidate <hook-name> <path>`: the `with` variant invokes the candidate file instead of the live `$HOOKS/<hook>`. The `without` variant is unaffected. Also supports an optional task `seed` field for stateful hooks (the stuck-loop hook reads `STUCK_STATE_FILE` so the eval isolates per-task state).
- `hooks/cycle.sh` (P7) — on gate PASS, starts a `deploy-watch` with the pre-deploy held-out lift as the baseline, and the report's "what to do next" instructs the host to run `deploy-watch.sh check` after the PR merges and `revert` on REGRESSION.
- `check-stuck-loop.sh` (P7) — now reads `STUCK_STATE_FILE` (env override) so the eval harness isolates per-task state. The bench grew from 21 to 25 tasks (the fifth enforcement hook, `check-stuck-loop.sh`, now has eval coverage — 2 seen, 2 heldout).
- [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md) (P7) — adds the post-merge watch flow and the close-the-loop gating section. [`docs/skill-catalog-efficiency.md`](docs/skill-catalog-efficiency.md) — competitive analysis of lean harnesses (~10-43 skills vs our 235) + a concrete reduction plan (dedup, hide sub-skills, per-agent permissions, guardrail tightening).

### Self-improvement flywheel (deep-research synthesis — P8)

P8 lands the four cherrypicks from the 52-repo deep-research survey ([`docs/harness-research-synthesis.md`](docs/harness-research-synthesis.md)) that compound the flywheel without adding runtime dependencies. Each is advisory — none blocks, none mutates memory directly.

- `hooks/reorder-context.sh` (PostToolUse) — LongContextReorder (LlamaIndex): reorders retrieved chunks so the highest-scoring land at the start/end of the window (the attention-favorable positions), since the middle is the "lost" region. Writes a digest to `.harness/runtime/reordered-chunks/`; never blocks.
- `hooks/checklist-gate.sh` (PreToolUse) — binary-checklist gates (awesome-cursorrules): a tracked checklist at `.harness/checklists/security.md` gates security-sensitive work; each item is a yes/no, not prose for the model to interpret.
- `hooks/transcript-scanner.sh` — transcript scanners (inspect-ai): complements `diagnose.sh` (the "what broke" half) with the "what the agent did that evals wouldn't flag" half — refusals (capability loss masked as success), evaluation-awareness (test-gaming), environment-drift (unremediated missing deps), hallucination signals (cited paths that failed to read), excessive-agency (force-push / `rm -rf` / `sudo` / `chmod 777` without an explicit ask), and prompt-injection tells (untrusted tool output followed as instructions). Findings stage to `.harness/forge/` for host-agent review, like `distill`. Wired into `cycle.sh` TRACK A as step 4. CLI: `--since <iso>`, `--status`.

### Self-improvement flywheel (smart approvals, reflection, TextGrad — P9)

P9 lands the three higher-value/higher-risk cherrypicks the synthesis deferred after P8. Each is advisory — none blocks, none mutates memory directly, all preserve the eight load-bearing invariants.

- `hooks/policy-gate.sh` (P9.1) — Smart Approvals prefix-rule learning (OpenAI Codex CLI): a tracked `.harness/approval-rules.json` backs learned prefix rules. A matching ALLOW rule upgrades REQUIRE_APPROVAL→ALLOW (auto-approve, logged); a matching DENY rule forces DENY (defense in depth); an ALLOW rule can never override a base DENY (the hard floor). The hook SUGGESTS rules on unmatched REQUIRE_APPROVAL; the host persists them via `--learn` (governance stays outside the model). Every auto-decision still appends to the tamper-evident ledger with `reason=auto:<prefix>`. New CLI: `--rules`, `--learn <ALLOW|DENY> <prefix> --rationale "..."`.
- `hooks/reflect-retry.sh` (P9.2) — inline retry-with-reflection (Reflexion, NeurIPS 2023): per-task reflection on a gate FAIL, distinct from the batch flywheel. Produces a structured `{what_failed, why, what_to_avoid, what_to_try_next}` digest to `.harness/forge/reflections/`; `propose.sh` injects it into section 3.5 so the next proposal retries WITH the reflection as context. Bounded by a max-retry cap (N=3 without an intervening gate PASS) — after the cap, the target is parked BLOCKED for human intervention (honors do-not-adopt #2). Fires only on eval-gated failures (honors contradiction #1). CLI: `--status`, `--count <target>`.
- `hooks/textgrad.sh` (P9.3) — TextGrad textual-gradient optimization (Nature 2025): a prescriptive gradient that complements (not replaces) the evolutionary proposer. Where the reflection is narrative (what failed and why), the gradient is PRESCRIPTIVE (which lines/sections to change and how). `propose.sh` injects it into section 3.6. Opt-in: one gradient per reflection (textgrad refuses without a reflection — no loss signal to backpropagate; honors do-not-adopt #7). CLI: `--status`.
- `hooks/propose.sh` (P9.2/P9.3) — gains sections 3.5 (latest reflection) + 3.6 (textual gradient) so the proposing model anchors on the reflection + gradient in addition to the non-Markovian history.
- `hooks/cycle.sh` (P9.2/P9.3) — on a gate FAIL (step 8), runs reflect-retry then textgrad as advisory sub-steps before the report. Step count stays 9; reflection+gradient are sub-steps of the gate-fail branch.

## Skills: 50 repo-tracked (consolidated from 103 → 50)

Skills are autonomous entry points. See `~/.claude/SKILLS.md` for the complete reference, [`docs/skill-catalog-efficiency.md`](docs/skill-catalog-efficiency.md) for the competitive analysis + reduction plan (103 → 50 via skill-family merges, stack-specific removal, and project-specific removal), and [`docs/harness-research-synthesis.md`](docs/harness-research-synthesis.md) for the 52-repo deep-research survey that informs P8.

**Consolidated catalog**: the skill catalog was reduced from 103 repo-tracked skills to 50 by merging skill families (ponytail×5→1, RAG×6→1, debug×2→1, test×6→1, session×2→1, refactor×2→1), removing stack-specific skills (shadcn, tailwind-design-system, webapp-testing), plugin-injected meta-skills, and project-specific skills. 53 skills archived in `claude/skills/.archive/` (recoverable).

**Core Development** (14): add, debug, fallback, impeccable, loop, plan, ponytail, refactor, review, scope-it, ship, tdd, test-driven-development, verify

**Architecture & Design** (7): architecture-patterns, codebase-design, decide, decide-now, domain-modeling, frontend-design, prototype

**Context & Memory** (8): codebase-memory, context-pack, context-save, graphify, handoff, knowledge-loop, memory-prune, resume

**Orchestration** (5): dispatch, loop-engineer, next-priority, orchestrate, three-man-team

**Session** (1): session-bootstrap

**Quality & Release** (8): changelog-update, ci-watch, dep-sweep, pr-merge-readiness, quality-assurance, quality-gates, setup-pre-commit, version-bump

**RAG** (2): rag-maintenance, recall

**Planning & Meta** (5): brainstorming, request-refactor-plan, secure, skill-creator-plugin, xp

The full catalog with triggers and frontmatter details is indexed by `hooks/skill-index.sh` and listed in `~/.claude/SKILLS.md`. Archived skills can be restored from `claude/skills/.archive/`.

## Standards & Policies

Key policy documents in `~/.agents/skills/standards/`:

- **agent-routing.md** — when to use which agent type, read-only enforcement
- **composite-contract.md** — composite-first principle, bail-out detection
- **pr-conventions.md** — PR title/body/attribution standards
- **graphify-discipline.md** — graph-first token discipline
- **decision-discipline.md** — research-before-deciding rules
- **artifact-schema.md** — structured artifact formats
- ... (14+ more policy docs)

---

## Configuration

### Model Tiering
- **Main loop:** Sonnet 4.6 (execution default)
- **Subagents:** Haiku 4.5 (mechanical tasks, fast)
- **Opus:** Explicitly invoked for complex reasoning, ADR writing
- **Autocompact:** 85% context threshold

### Hard Rules (Non-Negotiable)
1. Never automate on PRs with human reviewer comments
2. Parallel execution mandatory for ≥2 independent tasks (use worktrees for same-repo)
3. Analysis subagents read-only by agentType, not just prompt
4. No big-bang rewrites without demand measurement gate
5. Idempotency: state-check before mutation
6. Dispatcher ≠ executor boundary (no logic in orchestrators)
7. Repository as single source of truth
8. No Claude co-author attribution on commits/PRs
9. Storage on External HD (/Volumes/External HD/Desenvolvimento/)
10. Stuck protocol: >2 attempts without progress → surface, switch approach, escalate

### Default Behaviors
- **Caveman mode ON** — terse, drop filler, keep technical substance
- **Skill-first execution** — skills invoked autonomously when matching
- **Composite-first** — composite-router detects intent, emits `🎯 Composite match: /<name>`
- **Graph-first token discipline** — query graph before file reads
- **Signal-first output** — verdict + top-3 findings; "X more — ask for full list" if >3

---

## Optimal Usage Patterns

### Daily Workflow
```
1. /session-bootstrap (chains resume/priority/context-pack)
2. /plan or /scope-it for complex work
3. /dispatch or /orchestrate (≥2 independent tasks) or /loop (single task)
4. /review + /quality-gates or /verify (before merge)
5. /ship + /knowledge-loop (release, memory, handoff)
```

### Using Composites
When composite-router emits `🎯 Composite match: /<name>`: invoke that composite. Running sub-skills manually skips critical phases.

| Task | Use Composite | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| Refactor a module | `/request-refactor-plan` + `/orchestrate` | Preserves plan → team → validation → decision capture without restoring archived wrapper names |
| Onboard repo | `/session-bootstrap` + `/quality-assurance` | Intake, context, gates, and first safe action |
| Build feature from scratch | `/scope-it` + `/frontend-design`/`tdd`/`ship` | Research, scope, design, test, and release through active skills |
| Health check | `/quality-assurance` | Composes tests, config, security, MCP, and release evidence |
| End session | `/knowledge-loop` | Captures memory, curates weak recall, and writes handoff |

### Model Selection
- **Haiku:** Mechanical tasks (formatting, symbol lookup, grep, simple renames), subagent batch work
- **Sonnet (default):** Implementation, feature work, code review, test generation
- **Opus:** Orchestration, critic role, architectural decisions, ADR writing

Use the model-tier policy in `AGENTS.md` before multi-agent work. Never override for speculative speed.

### Parallel Execution
For ≥2 independent units (parallel investigations, multi-repo sweeps, batch fixes):
1. Dispatch one Agent per unit in SINGLE tool-use block
2. Use worktrees if same repo: `/Volumes/External HD/Desenvolvimento/.worktrees/<task>-<n>/`
3. Set correct `agentType` (Explore for analysis, general-purpose for execution)
4. Use `parallel()` or `pipeline()` in Workflow scripts

### Context Management
- **Auto-compaction:** At 85% fill, `auto-context-pack.sh` warns + suggests `/compact`
- **Read dedup:** `read-dedup.sh` blocks re-reading same file twice
- **RTK detection:** `rtk-miss-detector.sh` flags Bash that should use Read tool
- **Large file warning:** >25KB read emits warning

If context bloat builds: `/compact` (saves ~30-40% tokens)

### Token Optimization
| Goal | Skill | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| ~75% token compression | `/caveman` | Drops filler/articles/pleasantries while keeping full technical accuracy. Persists until toggled off. |
| Minimal solutions | `/ponytail` | Forces simplest, shortest, most minimal solution (YAGNI, stdlib before deps, one line before fifty). |
| Audit repo or diff for bloat | `/ponytail` | Built-in audit/review mode for over-engineering, ranked by evidence and size of cut. |
| Track deferred shortcuts | `ponytail:` comments | Mark deliberate shortcuts with ceiling and upgrade path in code. |
| Historical token spend | hook reports | Analyze session JSONLs, cache hit rates, and weekly trends through diagnostics. |
| Context bloat | `/context-pack` | Build focused context before large changes; compact when needed. |
| Load only relevant context | `/context-pack` | Build a task-aware context bundle before large changes or unfamiliar work. |

### Knowledge-Brain & RAG
The profile ships a **Megabrain** system: one vault for all projects (memory + graphs + RAG).

| Goal | Skill | What it does |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Semantic lookup | `/recall` | One-shot lookup against the local RAG index across memory, plans, handoffs, skills, and code. |
| Code → knowledge graph | `/graphify` | Turn code/docs/papers/images into a knowledge graph for structural queries. |
| Structural code queries | `/codebase-memory` | Knowledge graph for call chains, dead code, fan-out, impact analysis. |
| Capture and preserve knowledge | `/knowledge-loop` | Recall → capture → curate weak retrievals → handoff. |
| RAG index audit | `/rag-maintenance` | Integrated quality, coverage, drift, curation, and rebuild guidance. |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Diagnosis | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| Hooks not firing | `bat -p ~/.claude/tool-failures.log \| jq '\[\]'`; verify settings.json | Increase timeout, debug hook directly, check dependencies |
| Composite not invoked | Check session.log for `Composite match`; verify intent matches skill | Invoke directly: `/composite-name` |
| RAG retrieval stale | `/rag-maintenance` scans quality, coverage, drift, and gaps | Reindex through the maintenance workflow |
| Agent spawn failed | Verify agent exists: `fd -t f name ~/.claude/agents/` | Use default agent or check agent file syntax |
| Memory not persisting | Check sync: `bat -p ~/.claude/.sync.log` | `/sync-memories` explicitly; verify frontmatter |
| Slow hooks / timeouts | `time bash ~/.claude/hooks/name.sh` | Increase timeout in settings.json or optimize hook |
| Parallel agents conflicting | Verify worktrees: `ls /Volumes/External\ HD/Desenvolvimento/.worktrees/` | Ensure `isolation: "worktree"` on agents |
| Token budget hit | `/token-audit` for analysis | `/compact` for relief; `/update-config` to raise limit |
